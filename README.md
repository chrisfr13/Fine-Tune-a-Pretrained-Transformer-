# Fine-Tune-a-Pretrained-Transformer

In this exercise, i will deal with pretrained transformer 
models by fine-tuning a model on the Airline Tweets dataset. 

Jupyter Notebook Submission: 
1. Model Fine-Tuning: 
• Load and preprocess the Airline Tweets dataset. 
• Tokenize the text using a transformer-compatible tokenizer. 
• Load a pretrained transformer model and fine-tune it on the 
dataset. 
2. Learning Curves: 
• Plot and present the training and validation loss curves over 
epochs. 
   Also , include the training and validation accuracy curves. 
3. Confusion Matrix: 
• Evaluate the model on the test or validation set. 
• Visualize the confusion matrix to analyze performance across 
sentiment classes. 
4. Brief Explanation: 
• Provide a short description of the transformer model architecture. 
• Explain any modifications I made to optimize the model (e.g., 
freezing layers, adjusting learning rates).
